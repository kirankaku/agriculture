                <h3>INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC FARMING:</h3>
                <P>Organic farming is a system for crops that emphasizes environmental protection and the use of natural
                    farming techniques. It is concerned not only with the end-product, but with the entire system used
                    to produce and deliver the agricultural product. To this end, the entire farm cycle, from production
                    and processing, to handling and delivery, excludes the use of artificial products such as
                    genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and certain external agricultural inputs such as pesticides
                    and synthetic fertilizers. Organic farmers rely instead on natural farming methods and modern
                    scientific ecological knowledge in order to maximize the long-term health and productivity of the
                    ecosystem, enhance the quality of the products, and protect the environment. Proponents of organic
                    methods believe that it is a more sustainable and less damaging approach to the environment.</P>

                <h3>BENFITS OF ORGANIC FARMING:</h3>
                <P> Increase long-term fertility of the soil.<br>
                    ➣It helps in maintaining environment health by reducing the level of pollution.<br>
                    ➣It reduces human and animal health hazards by reducing the level of residues in 
                    the product.<br>
                    ➣It helps in keeping agricultural production at a higher level and makes it 
                    sustainable.<br>
                    ➣It reduces the cost of agricultural production and also improves the soil health.<br>
                    ➣It ensures optimum utilization of natural resources for short-term benefit and 
                    helps in conserving them for future generation.<br>
                    ➣It not only saves energy for both animal and machine, but also reduces risk of crop pollution.<br></P>

                <h3>KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANIC FARMING:</h3>
                <P> Relies primarily on local, renewable resources.<br>
                    ➣Makes efficient use of solar energy and the production potential of biological 
                    systems.<br>
                    ➣Maintains the fertility of the soil.<br>
                    ➣Maximizes recycling of plant nutrients and organic matter.<br>
                    ➣Does not use organisms or substances foreign to nature.<br>
                    ➣Maintains diversity in the production system as well as the agricultural landscape.<br>
                    ➣Gives farm animal’s life conditions that correspond to their ecological role and 
                    allow them a natural behavior.<br>
                    ➣Careful attention to the impact of the farming system on the wider environment.<br></P>

                <h3>CONCLUSIONS:</h3>
                <P>1. Organic farming is an effective way to produce healthy and nutritious food while 
                    protecting the environment.<br>
                    2. Organic farming reduces the use of synthetic chemicals, which can be harmful to 
                    the environment and human health.<br>
                    3. Organic farming promotes biodiversity, which helps to maintain the balance of 
                    ecosystems and preserve natural resources.<br>
                    4. Organic farming is an important contributor to global food security, providing 
                    healthy and affordable food to people in developing countries.<br>
                    5. Organic farming supports sustainable development, helping to reduce poverty and 
                    improve livelihoods in rural communities.<br>
                    6. Organic farming practices can help to mitigate the effects of climate change by 
                    reducing greenhouse gas emissions and sequestering carbon in the soil. <br></P>
